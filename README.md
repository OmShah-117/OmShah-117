# Hi there, I’m **Om Shah** 👋  
**Curiosity is the first step of innovation.**  

I’m a passionate Data Scientist from India, currently exploring the depths of **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, Generative AI, Data Science**, and more. I love space, the universe, and exploring ideas — both through code and through curiosity-driven learning.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me  

- 🎓 Currently a student, constantly learning and building.  
- 🔭 I’m interested in applying ML/AI for real-world problems — from data visualization to predictive modelling, and possibly space / scientific-data projects (inspired by my love for cosmos and physics).  
- 🌱 I enjoy reading about space, universe and physics.  
- 🌳 I love planting trees and contributing to a greener world in my free time.  
- 💬 Ask me about **Python**, **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, **Data Science**, **NLP / GenAI**, **Data Visualization**, or just “space & universe”!
